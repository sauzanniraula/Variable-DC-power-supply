# Variable DC Power Supply

## Overview

The Variable DC Power Supply is a project designed to provide a stable and adjustable DC output voltage for various electronic applications. This power supply is ideal for powering circuits, testing components, and conducting experiments in electronics.

## Features

- Adjustable output voltage: 1V to 30V (or as specified)
- Current limiting feature to protect connected components
- Digital display to show output voltage and current
- Compact design for easy integration into your workspace
- Simple user interface with knobs and switches

## Components Used

- Voltage Regulator (e.g., LM317)
- Capacitors
- Resistors
- Potentiometer
- Digital Voltmeter (optional)
- Power Supply Unit (for input)
- PCB or Breadboard (for prototyping)



### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting the project:

- Basic understanding of electronics and circuit design
- Soldering skills (if assembling on a PCB)
- Necessary tools (multimeter, soldering iron, etc.)

### Assembly

1. **Assemble the Circuit**: Follow the schematic diagram to connect the components on a breadboard or PCB.
2. **Adjust Potentiometer**: Use the potentiometer to adjust the output voltage as needed.
3. **Testing**: Before connecting sensitive components, test the output with a multimeter to ensure the desired voltage is achieved.

### Usage

1. Connect the power supply to an AC source (if applicable).
2. Adjust the output voltage using the knobs.
3. Connect your load (circuit/component) to the output terminals.
4. Monitor the output voltage and current on the digital display (if included).

## Troubleshooting

- **No Output Voltage**: Check all connections and ensure the power supply is turned on.
- **Incorrect Voltage Output**: Verify the settings on the potentiometer and check for faulty components.
- **Overheating**: Ensure the current limit is set appropriately to avoid overheating components.
